## <a href="head1">Overview</a>
This is a simple and real-life problem solving implementation of *Random Forest Classifier* on Customer Churn Prediction in a bank. This model takes a preprocessed dataset, being trained on training set, next predicts on the test dataset with an accuracy around 85%.

## <a href="head2">Motivation</a>
It's big deal, for a bank, to continue the relationship with their promising customers as well as provide them offers depending on the fact if a particular customer will have an active a/c or not. That's why it's required to predict if the customer will churn or not. Hence,  a proper ,model will play a vital role to predict with high accuracy. 
Random forest is a very versatile algorithm capable of solving both classification and regression tasks.Also, the hyperparameters involved are easy to understand and usually, their default values result in good prediction. Random forest solves the issue of overfitting which occurs in decision trees.
One limitation of Random forest is, too many trees can make the processing of the algorithm slow.
